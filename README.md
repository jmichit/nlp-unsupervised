# NLP + Unsupervised learning project

## Proiect proposal
Using NLP algorithms and techniques to analyze the scripts of TNG, topic modeling to see categories of issues discussed, and clustering to see if we can isolate lines by one character or another. 

Identify if topics change by season and if characters evolve over the series. 
(Possibly) link topics to ratings - see if correlation

## Data
Scripts for each episode in the TV series "Star Trek: The Next Generation" (TNG)

(Potentially) ratings information by episode
